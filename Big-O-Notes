The RAM Model of Comutation 
  - RAM stands for Random Access Machine 
  - Lets us analyze algos independent of the hardware / language  
  - We measure the runtime of an algo by counting the number of steps 
  - Case Complexity 
    * Best Case: the function defined by the minimum number of steps taken on an
      instance of size n
    * Average Case:
    * Worst Case:
